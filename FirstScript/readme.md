 ## First Robot Framework Test Automation Project :
 
***
 
**Get Set Go !**
 - This is my first robot framework script, involving Selenium Library to automate test for a dummy      website for customer relation management. I familiarised myself with basic structure and the        awesome results/ log files generated by RObot Framework.
 - In the initial commits I had learnt to Install and Configure the Robot Framework test automation      tool, along with Selenium Library. 
 - I used Pycharm IDE with Intellibot plugin for creating the scripts. Configured the PyCharm IDE to    enable version control using github.
 - Additionaly I learnt Windows Command Line basics and how to Run/Execute Robot Framework automated    tests from Windows Command Line / PyCharm IDE Terminal / Batch File.
